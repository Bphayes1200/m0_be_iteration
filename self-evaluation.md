# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
### I feel confident in my understanding of the each method.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
### It was definitely challenging, but I was able to push through and finally start to understand it. It was also fun to use multiple things that we have learned so far in one challenge.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
### I need to practice everything a little more just to feel pretty confident heading into the final evaluation, but overall, I feel like I have a good understanding of the content.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
### I don't have any questions at the moment.
